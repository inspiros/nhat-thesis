\subsection{MuHAVi dataset}
    The dataset MuHAVi is constructed and introduced by \cite{murtaza2016multi}. It is usually referred as MuHAVi-uncut because it contains full, raw videos of 17 actions, asynchronously captured by eight cameras that provide completely overlapping coverage of a rectangular action zone from different viewing directions.

    The actions are performed several times by 7 actors (5 males / 2 females). 
    %they are named as walk turn back, run stop, punch, kick, shotgun collapse, pull heavy object, pickup throw object, walk fall, look in car, crawl on knees, wave arms, draw graffiti, jump over fence, drunk walk, climb ladder, smash object, and jump over gap. 
    %The data was collected at rate of 25 fps with 720 $\times$ 576 resolution, except for 
    The $8^{th}$ camera whose data is not included in experiments of this paper due to absence of annotation.
