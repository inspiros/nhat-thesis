\textbf{\emph{Acknowledgements}}
\\\\

This thesis would not have been possible without the help of many people. First of all, I would like to thank Prof. Tran Thi Thanh Hai for being my advisor, and for enabling various cooperations throughout the years. Through these cooperations, I got to meet Prof. Masataka Goto and Dr.-Ing. Sebastian Stober, whom I would like to thank for serving as my reviewers.\\
I am grateful for my time spent at Fraunhofer IDMT, where I learned a lot about research and enjoyed a very warm and friendly working atmosphere. In particular, I would like to thank my colleagues Ania, Estefanía, Jakob, Patrick, Sascha, Christof, Christian, Stelios, and Daniel for their help and inspiration. In addition, I want to thank to my colleagues at AIST and at the Johns Hopkins University for their new perspectives.\\\\

%no other road, no other way, no day but today

%Words are flowing out / Like endless rain into a paper cup / They slither while they pass / They slip away across the universe
%There's nothing you can do that can't be done / Nothing you can sing that can't be sung / Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game / It's easy / All you need is love
%It's only a paper moon\\Sailing over a cardboard sea\\But it wouldn't be make-believe\\If you believed in me
%The world always seems brighter when youâ€™ve just made something that wasnâ€™t there before.
