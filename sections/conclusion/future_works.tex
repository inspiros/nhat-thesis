\section{Future Works} \label{sec:future_works}

    In the future, we will test our framework for HAR from unknown-viewpoint (testing view is not taken in training phase for building common space). In addition, to deal with continuous video streams, we will apply a fast gesture detection by a lightweight classifier and only activate the HAR once a gesture candidate is present. We will also deploy other modality such as optical flow or depth to make our framework more robust.
