\section{Drawbacks} \label{sec:drawbacks}
    The overall framework is not end-to-end trainable.
    The proposed pc-MvDA is a batch algorithm, in effect, it is essential to process whole training dataset at once to compute class means at each optimization step.
    This makes pc-MvDA unsuitable to be a loss function that trains multiple large-scale neural networks concurrently, especially when input data is 3-dimensional spatio-temporal tensors.
